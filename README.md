# Summary of NoSQL Databases and DataLakeHouse

## NoSQL Databases
"NoSQL" is a term for databases that don't follow the usual SQL (relational) model. It was first named by Carlo Strozzi in 1998. 
In 2009, Johan Oskarsson gave it a broader meaning during discussions about open source databases, including various systems beyond the usual relational databases.

- **Key-value Database:** It is an unconventional approach storing data without relational ties, using a simple key-value method.
- **Document Database:** Storing data as documents, akin to key-value databases but with structured documents containing many key-value pairs, resembling JSON or XML.
- **Graph Database:** A fascinating extension of document databases, emphasizing relationships through nodes, properties, and edges.
- **Columnar Database:** Efficiently storing data in columns, these databases optimize data reading and query speed.
NoSQL databases offer diverse options beyond traditional systems, providing tailored solutions for various data storage needs.

## Data Lakehouse
A data lakehouse is a modern data management architecture that combines the flexibility of data lakes with the structured and transactional capabilities of data warehouses. 
It allows businesses to perform business intelligence and machine learning on all their data efficiently.
Advancements: metadata layers, optimized queries, and open formats reduce data stitching, simplifying access and enhancing analysis in the data lakehouse.
